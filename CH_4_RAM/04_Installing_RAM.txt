Installing RAM:
0. Use a anti-static wrist band.
1. Always read the motherboard's specifications to see what RAM sticks can be installed.
2. Push the tabs of the RAM slots down if there are any in order to prepare for insertion.
3. Align the notches of the RAM stick and the ones on the slots and drop the stick straight in.

An error message reporting that there is a problem in RAM most likely is caused by faulty installation, the RAM stick itself is almost always
fully working. A successful boot indicates a successful installation of the RAM.
