There are two types of RAM when it comes to capacity:
- Single sided: Has RAM only on a single side.
- Double sided: Has RAM on both sides

Motherboards might not always support double-sided RAM.

Multiple RAM slots on the motherboard allows for flexibility. The total RAM available is the sum of each RAM stick.

Memory channels are the links (wires) between your RAM and your CPU through which data moves between the two.
Motherboard's RAM slots are commonly in the form of "Dual-channel memory", which allows for the pair of RAM sticks to each
be placed in a specific slot. Both RAM sticks in a single channel must belong to the same model. 

If a motherboard had 2 channels available (A and B) and for channel A, 2 16 GB RAM sticks were used and for channel B, 2 4 GB RAM sticks
were used, what is the total available RAM on the system?
2 * 16 + 2 * 4 = 40 GB
