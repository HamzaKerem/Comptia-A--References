There is a wire in the back of every CPU called "power good wire". As soon as that wire gets enough voltage, the CPU starts running and it
then interacts with the BIOS and starts POST.

There are beep codes associated with POST that might communicate which specific components of the system failed. Each failed component
produces different "beeps". Beep codes are issued when error messages can't be displayed on the screen.

POST cards are external devices that can be plugged into the system in order to read the data being outputted by the POST program.
Each output produces a hexadecimal code (aka Q-code) which has a meaning that can be found in the motherboard's specification guide.
