Single Flash ROM chips (Flash Memory) is modernly used that can be "flashed"/reprogrammed, thus the BIOS can be updated.
However, improper flashing can completely ruin the motherboard. Steps for flashing the flash chip:

Real-Time Clock (RTC) is an integrated circuit on a computer's motherboard that is powered by the CMOS battery. The RTC provides an 
accurate date and time, in addition to allowing a computer to regulate the timing and speed of all its functions.
Every motherboard has a built-in battery which powers the RTC when the device is not connected to a power supply. If the battery fails,
the system time will slow down, system data will be lost, etc. CR2032 is the standard CMOS and RTC battery.
