Firmware is software that's embedded in a piece of hardware. The firmware in the motherboard is called BIOS. 
It allows for the interactions between hardware devices. Services are BIOS programs that make hardware functional.

Modern motherboards have two BIOS chips in case of failure.

The booting process completes a Power On Self Test (POST) before booting into a OS. The POST can be found in the BIOS chip.
System Setup (CMOS) is also a part of the firmware.
