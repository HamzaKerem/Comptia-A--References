A data bus allows for data to travel between computer components.

Every CPU has a built-in machine language interpreter.
CPUs also have built-in registers (referred to as AX, BX, CX, etc.) that
temporarily store data for calculations. A single register simply allows for the storage of
multiple bits.

Conceptual binary instructions:
10000000: put the next line in register AX
10010000: put the next line in register BX
10110000: add together AX and BX, store result in AX 
11000000: put the value in AX on the External Data Bus

CPUs also consist of clocks which inform CPUs to perform an action.
Modern day systems are so complex that the clock signal might have to be 
repeatedly sent to the CPU in order for it to take on the next command.
CPUs get more sophisticated as their clock response time increase, making them
higher quality.

The CPU consists of logic units which do all the arithmetic calculations.
A CPU pipeline (aka core) allows for parallel execution by overlapping instructions.
