The CPU socket (or slot) refers to the component where the CPU is placed into.

A micro architecture is a circuit diagram and the way a given instruction set architecture (ISA) is implemented in a particular processor.

Intel releases each new micro architecture under a new family name. i.e.:
Nehalem (1st Gen)
Sandy Bridge (2nd Gen)
...
Coffee Lake (8th Gen)

Each new micro architecture release also accompanies a CPU socket release.  

There are commonly two types of surface-mounts:
- Pin Grid Array: Has pins sticking out of the CPU, not on the socket. The socket has the holes.
- Land Grid Array: Has pads on the CPU, not on the socket. The socket has the pins.

Common modern sockets:
- LGA 1151 (Intel)
- LGA 2066 (Intel)
- AM4 (AMD)
- TR4 (AMD)
