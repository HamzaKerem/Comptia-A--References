A motherboard's speed might be incompatible with the CPU's speed, same goes for the sockets. Always check before buying.
An AMD motherboard will only work with an AMD CPU, same goes for Intel.

Installing The CPU:
1. For "zero insertion force" sockets, lift up the insertion bar.
2. Carefully remove the CPU from its packaging and get it ready for installation. Do NOT touch its pins or lands/pads.
3. Locate the orientation notch of the CPU, the notch which has a different shape than all of the other corners.
4. Align the orientation notch of the CPU and the matching notch of the socket and install the CPU carefully.
5. Close the insertion bar.

The installation of the fan changes over time and differs from model to model. As a rule of thumb, look for
the placing of the thermal paste and notches that can be aligned to fit right into the motherboard.
Make sure to also connect the fan's power connector to the motherboard.

Liquid cooling systems can also be used to further increase cooling efficiency. It reduces a lot of fan noise.
