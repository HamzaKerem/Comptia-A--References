When a program is "clicked" on, the program data is copied off the hard drive to the RAM.
Once in RAM, individual lines of the program are fed into the CPU via its external data bus.

The CPU is faster than the RAM, while the RAM is faster than the hard drive.

SRAM (Static RAM) is a type of RAM typically used for caching and storing data in the internal registers
of the CPU. SRAM is faster and more expensive than regular RAM.

If an instruction required by the CPU isn't available, a pipeline stall will occur.

Caching (pronounced "cash-ing") allows for short-term storage to be quickly reached.
Vast majority of CPUs come with 3 built-in caches. The level 1 (aka L1) cache runs at the same speed as the CPU.
The level 2 cache feeds the level 1 cache and is a lot bigger than it, yet it will run at only about half
the speed. The level 3 cache, which is bigger than the L2 cache, runs at about the base motherboard speed 
(still a lot faster than the RAM) and allows to avoid pipeline stalls.

Set association defines how the different types of caches are efficient at being able to hand the right 
piece of code up to CPU. (Note: Not on the A+ exam)
